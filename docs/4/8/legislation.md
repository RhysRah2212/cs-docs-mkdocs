## Lesson Notes

### Data Protection Act (1984, 1998, 2018)
Introduced in 1984, this act was created due to public concern about the misuse of personal data in computers.
Over the years, it has been updated to reflect newer changes to computing and how data is used.
The latest edition implements the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This act requires that companies who store and process data must register with the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) (Information Commissioner's Office). 

There are a number of terms that are often used when discussing the DPA:

- **Personal Data** - This covers both facts and opinions about a living individual.
- **Data** - In the context of the DPA, this has a slightly different meaning to the term 'data' that you learned about at the beginning of the course. Here it means anything which is part of a record about an individual for example, Date of Birth, name, NI number. Data can be held on paper or on a computer.
- **Processing** - This covers the collection and storage and processing of personal data. The processing can include searching records, sorting data into order, comparing one record with another, altering the data, passing the data onto another party and removing it from the system.

There are also terms used to describe specific roles or responsibilities of people under the DPA.

- **Data Subject** - This is the person that the data is being collected from or stored about.
- **Data Controller** - This is often the person in charge of the organisation - but it doesn't necessarily have to be. This person decides what data the organisation needs to collect and what it will be used for. This is the person who must apply for permission to collect and store data in the first place. The Data Controller is responsible for ensuring that any collection, storage and processing of data is done in accordance with the DPA.
- **Data Processor** - Data is often processed by third parties who are not part of the Data Controller's organisation. These data processors are usually hired by the Data Controller to process the data for a specific task. Even though they are not directly a part of the Data Controller's organisation, the Data Controller is responsible for ensuring that they process the data in accordance with the DPA.
- **Recipient** - This is any person who is employed to to access, use or process personal data as part of their job. This could be a secretary who needs to look up your address so that they can send a letter home to your parents. It could be your doctor who needs to know what allergies you have before prescribing you medicine. The recipient might work directly for the Data Controller or might be employed by a third party who has been hired to process the data.
- **Information Commissioner** - This is the person who has overall responsibility for enforcing the Data Protection Act across the UK. Organisations need to apply to them to in order to gain permission to collect and store personal data. The Information Commissioner also provides advice to companies and to the Government about issues related to the DPA. They also investigate complaints that are raised about any issues related to the DPA.

They must state their reasons for storing and processing data, and ensures 8 principles:

1. Data must be processed fairly and lawfully
2. Data must only be used for the specific purpose(s) for which it was collected
3. Data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which it is processed
4. Data must be kept up to date and accurate
5. Personal information must not be kept for longer than is needed
6. Individuals have the right to access of the data held about them
7. Data must be stored and transferred securely
8. Personal information must not be sent out of the EEA (European Economic Area) unless adequate data protection is in place

### Freedom of Information Act
The Freedom of Information Act enforces transparency in public organisations, by allowing data subjects to access personal and non-personal information held by these organisations. This is done usually through websites and email communications to request data from public and governmental agencies. This act and the Data Protection Act is overseen by the Information Commissioner.

### Computer Misuse Act (1990)
The Computer Misuse Act was introduced in 1990 to combat new legal issues faced by the development of computers and telecommunications devices. It was found, in a 1988 court case, that there were no laws existing that prevented the misuse of computers, so one was created.

There are three main offences for computer usage:

#### Offence 1 - Unauthorised access to computer material
This is the lowest level of offence and is one that many of us might be guilty of at some stage in our school or working lives. If you break into someone's account by guessing their password, or if you looked at their files without permission, you are breaking the law. This offence carries the risk of being sentenced to six months in prison and/or a hefty fine. 

#### Offence 2 - Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate a crime
The difference between this and the first offence is that the person  gaining access to someone elses' system is doing so with the sole  purpose of doing something illegal. This might mean that they had to guess or steal the password in order to get into someone's user area or their bank account. They could do this by trial and error or by using special programs such as spyware or keylogging software, or they could use a relatively new technique called 'phishing'. 

They might want to steal some company secrets or they might want to transfer some money out of your bank account into their own. Anyone caught doing this risks up to a five year prison sentence and/or a hefty fine.

#### Offence 3 - Unauthorised modification of computer material
This offence relates to the deletion or changes made to files with  the intent to cause damage to an individual or company. The difference is 'the intent to cause damage'. This offence also covers purposely introducing viruses to other peoples' systems. If you knowingly transmit a virus to others, you are guilty under this section of the Computer Misuse Act. This offence carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and/or a fine.

#### Offence 3a - Making, supplying or obtaining material that could be used in computer misuse offences
- **Making** - This includes the writing or creation of  computer viruses, worms, trojans, malware, malicious scripts etc.
- **Supplying** - This part covers the distribution of any of the above material whether you have created it yourself or obtained it from elsewhere. It is an offense to supply or distribute these files to others.
- **Obtaining** - If you purposely obtain malicious files such as as  computer viruses or  scripts that you know could be used to damage computer systems then you have committed an offence under the Computer Misuse Act.

Widespread usage of the Internet came mostly after this act was introduced, which meant that this act became significantly harder to enforce. This is due to the ability of hackers to be far away from their target, and even in other countries with different (often relaxed) laws about computer usage.

### Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (2000)
The RIP Act was introduced in 2000 to regulate and state the powers that government agencies have with regards to investigation of crime. This act is a general act covering many areas, but was introduced due to changes in telecommunications and the internet.

This act gives certain government agencies rights to intercept and decrypt data when there is suspicion of criminal activity. Decryption rights also include forcing the person who encrypted data to tell the authorities how to decrypt it.  It also allows employers and schools to monitor computer activity, however this power is more limited compared to government agencies.

### Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988)
This Act was introduced to protect the investment of time, money and effort by the people who create original pieces of work. This can mean authors of books, composers of music, the makers of a film, a computer game designer or a company that creates applications for smart phones. They all invest a great deal of time and money to produce these things and quite rightly, their work belongs to them. It's two main purposes are:

- To ensure people are rewarded for their endeavours 
- To give protection to the copyright holder if someone tries to copy or steal their work.

It is estimated that almost 40% of software is copied. This has a huge impact on the software industry. By just cutting the software piracy rate from 25% to 15% would result in an extra 40,000 jobs in the IT sector and an extra Â£2.5 billion in tax revenues.

### The Health and Safety Act (1992)
This act states that an employer must (if applicable to their work):

1. Provide tiltable screens.
2. Provide anti-glare screen filters.
3. Provide adjustable chairs.
4. Provide foot supports.
5. Make sure lighting is suitable.
6. Make sure there is sufficient space for people to work.
7. Train employees how to use work stations correctly.
8. Ensure employees have sufficient breaks.
9. Pay for regular eye sight tests for anyone who needs prescription glasses in order to use the computer.

#### Software Designers
There is a web-design specialism called 'User Experience' or 'UX' for short that seeks to make the user experience as pleasant and efficient as possible. In major web and software companies there will be people specifically employed to look after this aspect. This 'UX' or user experience includes some basic things designed for user comfort and safety:

1. Screen layouts are clear so that eye strain is minimised.
2. Colour schemes should have good contrast to prevent eye strain.
3. Menu systems should be logical to prevent stress and annoyance.
4. Drop down lists to reduce data entry and prevent RSI.
5. Help facilities should be available to reduce stress.

#### Safety
Employers have a legal obligation to ensure that their employees are working in a safe environment. This is done by usually enforcing the following things:

1. All wires and cables should be secured out of the way to ensure that no one can trip over them or accidentally pull them out of the equipment.
2. Electrical sockets should not be overloaded because they can overheat.  
3. Electrical equipment should be safety tested at least once a year.
4. Fire extinguishers should be available, including specialist ones to deal with electrical fires.
5. Fire exits should be clearly marked and free from clutter.
6. There should be adequate space around desks so that people can move without banging into furniture.
7. Bags and obstacles should be stored out of the way so that people can't trip over them .
8. Desks should be strong enough to support computers and equipment.
9. Heating and ventilation should be suitable for the working environment.
10. Food and drink should not be consumed at the computer because spillages could result in shorting of the electrical components.
11. Crumbs lodged under the keyboard can cause individual keys to be difficult to press.
12. Crumbs in and around the keyboard are unhygienic and could encourage vermin.

### Code of Conduct
This is not actual legislation, but it is guidelines set by a company regarding the actions of employees. This is not legally enforceable, but could have consequences for employees who disregard it. Breaches of the code could result in dismissal of employees or exclusion of students.

One example of a code of conduct is for the BCS (British Computer Society), which is a condition of membership to the society; however it covers more issues than just those regarding the society itself. It sets out general rules for use of computers and the internet, so it is often used by other companies and organisations.
